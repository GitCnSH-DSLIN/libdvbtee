dvbtee & libdvbtee
==================

Introduction
============

libdvbtee is a stream parser and service information aggregator library for
MPEG2 transport streams. The library includes a program service information
(PSI) parser and support for various network streaming methods and is aware
of the linux-dvb kernel API.

The library contains enough functionality to power a full featured television
middleware application, including the ability to acquire and stream data
through UDP, TCP, HTTP, DMA and various other mechanisms.

libdvbtee_server allows for these features to be controlled from an http
session or command line interface, and can be used to control multiple tuners.

The dvbtee executable application provides a variety of features, including:
scanning, tuning, EPG browsing, receive incoming network streams,
stream out network streams, manage multiple tuners, and more...

This README file is a work-in-progress... I'll expand on this more soon.

Command line arguments:

  -a	adapter id
  -A	(1 for ATSC, 2 for ClearQAM)
  -c	channel to tune /
	comma (,) separated list of channels to scan /
	scan minimum channel
  -C	channel to tune /
	comma (,) separated list of channels to scan /
	scan maximum channel
  -f	frontend id
  -F	filename to use as input
  -t	timeout
  -T	number of tuners (dvb adapters) allowed to use, 0 for all
  -s	scan, optional arg when using multiple tuners: 
	1 for speed, 2 for redundancy, 
	3 for speed AND redundancy, 
	4 for optimized speed / partial redundancy
  -S	server mode, optional arg 1 for command server, 
	2 for http stream server, 3 for both
  -i	pull local/remote tcp/udp port for data
  -I	request a service and its associated PES streams by its service id
  -E	enable EPG scan, optional arg to limit the number of EITs to parse
  -o	output filtered data, optional arg is a filename / URI, ie udp://127.0.0.1:1234
  -O	output options: (or-able) 1 = PAT/PMT, 2 = PES, 4 = PSIP
  -d	debug level
  -h	display additional help

To tune to service id 1 of physical channel 33 and stream it to a udp port:
  ./dvbtee -c33 -I1 -oudp://192.168.1.100:1234

To tune the second frontend of adapter 1 and stream the full TS of physical channel 44 to a tcp listener:
  ./dvbtee -c44 -otcp://192.168.1.200:5555

To listen to a TCP port and stream to a UDP port:
  ./dvbtee -itcp://5555 -oudp://192.168.1.100:1234

To parse a captured file and filter out the PSIP data, saving the PAT/PMT and PES streams to a file:
  ./dvbtee -Finput.ts -O3 -ofile://output.ts

To parse a UDP stream for ten seconds:
  ./dvbtee -iudp://127.0.0.1:1234 -t10

To scan for ClearQAM services using 5 tuners optimized for speed and partial redundancy:
  ./dvbtee -A2 -T5 -s4
