dvbtee & libdvbtee
==================

Introduction
============

libdvbtee is a stream parser and service information aggregator library for MPEG2 transport streams.
The library contains parsing and streaming engines and is aware of the linux-dvb kernel API.

The library contains enough functionality to power a full featured middleware application,
including the ability to acquire and stream data through UDP, TCP, HTTP, DMA and various other mechanisms.

libdvbtee_server allows for these features to be controlled from a http session or command line interface,
and can be used to control multiple tuners.

The dvbtee executable application provides a variety of features, including: scanning, tuning, EPG browsing,
receive incoming network streams, stream out network streams, manage multiple tuners, and more...

This README file is a work-in-progress... I'll expand on this more soon.
