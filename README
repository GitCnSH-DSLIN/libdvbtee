dvbtee & libdvbtee
==================

Introduction
============

libdvbtee is a stream parser and service information aggregator library for
MPEG2 transport streams. The library includes a program service information
(PSI) parser and support for various network streaming methods and is aware
of the linux-dvb kernel API.

The library contains enough functionality to power a full featured television
middleware application, including the ability to acquire and stream data
through UDP, TCP, HTTP, DMA and various other mechanisms.

libdvbtee_server allows for these features to be controlled from an http
session or command line interface, and can be used to control multiple tuners.

The dvbtee executable application provides a variety of features, including:
scanning, tuning, EPG browsing, receive incoming network streams,
stream out network streams, manage multiple tuners, and more...

This README file is a work-in-progress... I'll expand on this more soon.
